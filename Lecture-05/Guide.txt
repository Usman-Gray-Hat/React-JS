REACT COMPONENTS:
=================

* Components are independent and reusable pieces of code.

* They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

* Components come in two types:

1. Class Components
2. Functional Components.

* But in this lecture, we will concentrate on Function components.

======================
FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS:
======================

* Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

* In older React code bases, you may find Class components primarily used.

* It is now suggested to use Function components, which were added in React 16.8.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
=========================

=> Right click on src folder -> create new file named as Header.js

=> In Header.js
   import React from 'react';
   function myHeader() {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>This is my Header</h1>
           </div>
       );
   }
   export default myHeader;


=> Right click on src folder -> create new file named as Sidebar.js

=> In Sidebar.js
   import React from 'react';
   function mySidebar() {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>This is my Sidebar</h1>
           </div>
       );
   }
   export default mySidebar;


=> Right click on src folder -> create new file named as Footer.js

=> In Footer.js
   import React from 'react';
   function myFooter() {
       return (
           <div>
               <h1>This is my Footer</h1>
           </div>
       );
   }
   export default myFooter;

* Note: Now, we have three components, let's render these components into specified HTML element.

=> In index.html
   <div id="root"> </div>

=> In index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
   import './index.css';
   import App from './App';
   import Header from './Header';
   import Sidebar from './Sidebar';
   import Footer from './Footer';
   import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   root.render(
     <>
       <Header/>
       <Sidebar/>
       <Footer/>
       </>
   );

* Note: Since we know that index.js is entry point of our React app. So, for making index.js file light weighted,
  we can use much recommended approach which is to return all our components in "App function" that exists inside
  "App.js" file which is a Default component of React application and then render App.js in index.js file.
  In this way index.js will become much light weighted.

           <div>
               <h1>This is my Footer</h1>
           </div>
       );
   }
   export default myFooter;

  In App.js
  import Header from './Header';
  import Sidebar from './Sidebar';
  import Footer from './Footer';

  function App() {
    return (
       <>
        <Header/>
        <Sidebar/>
        <Footer/>
       </>      
    );
  }
  export default App;

* Note: We have returned all our components in App.js, now let's render App.js component in index.js.

=> In index.js
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
   import './index.css';
   import App from './App';
   import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   root.render(
     <App/>
   );

* Important Points: Doesn't matter how many components you make, but make sure to import react module 
  from node_modules folder and write import line inside each & every component file at the top.
  import React from 'react';

* JSX code compile properly because of react module as react supports JSX.

* Only 1 default export is allowed per module/component. So, make only one function in each component.
